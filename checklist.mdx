### Cloud folder

The first thing you will need is a cloud folder in which you organize all the necessary content at the same place. You can then share this folder with your provider or with us.

### Property Images

You need one or many rendering(s) of your project. It cand also be a photo or many photos of your building. The required format is JPG. The maximum weight is 1MB, anything under is better. Images should not exceed 1000px horizontally.

- Use your best money-shot for this main image.
- If you have a multi-phase project, use a bird's eye-view of the project for the group image. [View a group project here.](https://www.planpoint.io/types/rentals)
- If you wish to use our [360Â° project feature](https://www.planpoint.io/new-releases/360-project), gather all the best shots from all around the building.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** Vertical images will look better than horizontal images, just like the one below:</Tip>

</Frame>

### Floors

You also need all the floor plates for all floors of your building. Each of them need to be separated for each floor and saved in JPG format. Consider adding the following elements to provide a better experience for your clients:

- Compass
- Landscaping
- Parking area
- Streets and directions
- Natural features like rivers, mountains, etc.
- Design cleaned out of construction or architectural details

Here's a good example:

</Frame>

### Unit layouts

All unit layout plans must be created in two versions: 

- **One JPG version** for the plan viewer. This is the first thing you see while looking at a specific unit.
- **One PDF version** for the download PDF button on every unit page.

<Info>When units span more than one floor, the **PDF** can contain multiple pages, but the **JPG** version of the same unit must be separated into multiple separate images - they will appear as a gallery.</Info>

</Frame>

### Unit list

You must have your project's unit list with all important information such as unit name, area, number of bedrooms, price, availability, occupancy dates, inclusions, etc.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** We provide an Excel [template that you can download](https://app.planpoint.io/assets/template.xlsx) and use as the basis for your unit list.</Tip>

Please view the video below to understand the proper formatting to be used in your document:

### Optional content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Interior renderings and images" icon="image">
      Planpoint allows you to add images for each unit. Please resize your images to max 1800px horizontally and no more than 1MB per image - images that are compressed will load faster for your clients! We recommend using free tools such as [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com) and [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app).

      Here's some ideas of what you can display:
      - interiors of units like kitchen, bathroom, dining room
      - exterior views from the point of view of the unit
      - project highlights

      </Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3D tours" icon="cube">
    Planpoint allows you to add 3D tours for each unit in your project. There's two different technologies for this. The base 3D tour is the one you see below, which 3D artists can create in any typical rendering software as a '360 image'. It can also be a simple Matterport tour.

      <Frame type="glass">
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/prGh742z/temp-Image-Pskz7l.avif" />
      </Frame>

    The second one is the [next-gen 3D tour](https://www.planpoint.io/new-releases/next-gen-3d-tours) which allows for dynamic choice of finishes, element selection and room measurements.
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Amenities" icon="water-ladder">
    You can also include renderings or photos of your amenities such as the pool, the terrace, the interior courtyard and use our **Amenities** feature to showcase them.
