### If you’re using Planpoint’s default Lead Gen Form

Additionally, you can also make use of UTM parameters to keep track of where specific leads are coming from.

You can use the **Redirect URL** to point to a thank you page on your website and Planpoint will dynamically add the specific UTM parameters that were present on the page when he filled up the form.

So, for example, let’s imagine you have the following setup:

- Your Planpoint Viewer is embedded at www.project.com/plans and;
- IYour redirect page after the form is completed is www.project.com/thank-you;
- You’re running an advertising campaign that adds various UTMs such as `?utm_source=google` to the base URL;
- So, www.project.com/plans becomes www.project.com/plans?utm_source=google ;
- After the visitor fills up the form, he’s automatically redirected to www.project.com/thank-you?utm_source=google where `?utm_source=google` was added dynamically.
