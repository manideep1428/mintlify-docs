    1. The **first** icon is for uploading a cover image for this specific unit. It will only appear in grid mode.
    2. The **second** icon is for uploading different finishes for this unit.
    3. The **third** icon is for uploading an image gallery for this specific unit. For example, you could show interior renderings or exterior drone views.

    7. The **seventh** icon allows you to define the perimeters of the lots in a Land project.
    8. The **eighth** icon lets you edit the unit number, the model number, the area, the number of bedrooms, the price, availability, the occupancy dates, inclusions, description, number of bathrooms and number of parking spaces.
    9. The **ninth** icon is used to delete this specific unit.

    - The **Name** is your internal referral number. It can be numerical or alphanumerical.
    - The **Model** number is the unit's model layout. A particular model can reappear on the same floor or on different floors. In such instance, simply writing the model number in this field will automatically fill up the area, number of bedrooms, price and availability fields.
    - You assign a **Type** if the unit is either a parking or an amenity.
    - The **Area** is the square footage or square meter of this particular plan. You decide wether to show net or gross area.
    - The **Bedrooms** field is a simple dropdown choice.
    - The **Price** number is the unit's price. For sales, you would enter the full list price (before or after tax is your choice). For rentals, you would enter the monthly rent amount.
    - The **Availability** field is a simple dropdown choice between Available, Unavailable, Sold and Reserved. The unavailable units will not be shown in the plan viewer and the sold units cannot be clicked on in the plan viewer.
    - The **Occupancy date** can be be selected on a calendar to show when the unit will be available.
    - The **Inclusions** can be added in a comma separated list. 
    - The **Description** of the unit must be added as a text.
    - For **Bathrooms**, just type the number of bathrooms the unit has.
    - For **Parking Spaces**, just type the number of parking spaces the unit has.

  <Step title="Step 4">
    A very important time-saver feature is the Multi-select content ability. This special action lets you apply many images, unit layouts in JPEG, unit layouts in PDF and embedded code (for 3D visits and videos) to many units at once.
