  <Step title="Step 3: Enter the members information">
    Choose a permission level and simply enter the user's email address. **Administrators** have all rights except deleting the current project - this is a right only the main initial owner of a Planpoint account has. **Editors** can only edit the information contained inside the unit module. This is particularly useful for sales admin.

  <Step title="Step 4: Accepting the invitation">
    The member that you invited will receive an email from support@planpoint.io asking them to accept the invitation by clicking on a hyperlink. They will be required to setup their account by creating a password to login. If invited to multiple projects with the same email, they will be able to see multiple projects in the dashboard and manage them from it.
